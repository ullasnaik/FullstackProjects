## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 4 - NewzApp Assignment

### Assignment Step Description

In this case study Newz Step 4, we will implement REST-based MicroServices with Spring Boot. Also, in this step, we will implement CI pipeline using GitLab CI and use Swagger for API documentation.
In this step, we will create this application in two parts 
    
        1. NewsService
        2. NewsSourceService

### Steps to be followed:

    Step 1: Clone the boilerplate in a specific folder on your local machine and import the same in your eclipse STS.
    Step 2: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for NewsService and run the test cases.
    Step 3: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for NewssourceService  and run the test cases.

### Project structure

The folders and files you see in this repositories, is how it is expected to be in projects, which are submitted for automated evaluation by Hobbes

    Project
	|
	├── NewsService                             // This is the microservice of News   
	├── NewsSourceService                       // This is the microservice of NewsSource   
	├── .gitignore			            // This file contains a list of file name that are supposed to be ignored by git 
	├── .gitlab-ci.yml		            // This file contains the configuration for CI 
	├── .project			            // This is automatically generated by eclipse, if this file is removed your eclipse will not recognize this as your eclipse project. 
    ├── README.md			            // This is a readme file about the NewzApp step4 assignment. 
	└── pom.xml 			            // This is the parent POM, which holds all the microservice projects.

> PS: All lint rule files are by default copied during the evaluation process, however if need to be customizing, you should copy from this repo and modify in your project repo


#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step4** of your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab-<org abbreviation>.stackroute.in/stack_java_newz/newz-step4-boilerplate.git assignment-solution-step4`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step4 folder

    `cd assignment-solution-step4`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step4` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab-<org abbreviation>.stackroute.in/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-step4`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed

### Important instructions for Participants
