ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
  - is a programming technique for converting 
    data between incompatible type 
  -	systems using object-oriented programming languages.

Class Student{
   rollno
   name
   score
 }
 
 Student s = new Student();
 s ---> object of a Student
 
 Mapping java Object into Database fields

Features of ORM

	- An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a code library 
	  that automates the transfer of data stored in 
	  relational databases.
	
ORM Tools
	Castor, TopLink,Spring DAO, Hibernate

Hibernate Framework
	-It is a Java framework 
	-simplifies the development of Java application to 
  		interact with the database. 
	-It is an open source, lightweight Framework
	-It is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool. 
	-It implements the specifications of JPA 
	     (Java Persistence API) for data persistence.
		 
Hibernate Block Diagram

Hibernate Properties -----------> Hibernate.cfg.xml
            driver information
			connection url
			username
			password
			dialect ------> type of Database used
			
XML Mapping ----------->  ClassName.hbm.xml
	Employee ------------->   employee.hbm.xml
	Student  ------------->   student.hbm.xml
	
	Mapping 
	   className  ------> TableName
	   attributes ------> columnname   
 


Configuration Object
	- It is the first Hibernate object ,we will create in 
    	any Hibernate application. 
	- It is usually created only once during application 
		initialization. 
	- It represents a configuration or properties file 
	   required by the Hibernate.
	- It provides two keys components :
    • 	Database Connection − 
			This is handled through one or more 
			configuration files supported by Hibernate. 
			These files are hibernate.properties and 
			hibernate.cfg.xml.
    • Class Mapping Setup − 
		This component creates the connection between the
		Java classes and database tables.

SessionFactory Object

 -SessionFactory object is created by Configuration Object.
 -It is a heavyweight object; 
 -It is usually created during application start up 
 
Session Object
	A Session is used to get a physical connection 
	with a database. 
	It is lightweight and designed to be instantiated 
	each time an interaction is needed with the database. 
	Persistent objects are saved and retrieved through a Session object.
	It should not be kept open for a long time 
	It is not thread safe and 
	It should be created and destroyed as per need.
	
Transaction Object
	It represents a unit of work with the 
	database transaction functionality. 
	Transactions in Hibernate are handled by the
	transaction manager.
