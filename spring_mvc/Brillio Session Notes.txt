1. MVC Architecture

2. Spring MVC

3. Dispatcher Servlet

4. Flow of SpringMVC

MVC stands for Model View Controller

Model 		: Encapsulates the Application Data (POJO)

View 		: Responsible for rendering the model data
       		  generates html output that the client's 
	   		  browsers.(HTML, JSP)
			  
Controller 	: process the user's request and build appropriate
              model and passes it to view for rendering
			  
Spring MVC

-> provides a Model-View-Controller Architecture

-> provides ready-made components which used to develop
   flexible and loosely-coupled Web Application

-> seperates the different Layers of the Application

				  -> Input Logic
				  -> Business Logic
				  -> UI
				  
 Dispatcher Servlet is otherwise called as Front-Controller
 
 -> handles all the HTTP Requests and Responses
 -> recieves the request from the user
 -> It consults the HandlerMapping to call appropriate
     controller
 -> Controller takes the request and call the appropriate
     service methods
 -> service method will set model data based on the defined
    business logic and returns view name to the Dispatcher 
	Servlet
 -> DS will take the help of ViewResolver to pick up the designed 
    view for request.
 -> once view is finalized, DS passes the model data to the view
 -> finally view will be rendered on the Browser.
 
 @RequestMapping : is used to map the URL to either a class or a
                    particular handler method.

 @Contoller : used to specify that the class will act as a controller
