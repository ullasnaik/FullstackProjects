1. Spring Cloud

2. Monolithic Architecture

3. Microservices

4. Implement Microservices 
    (SpringBoot + MongoDB)
	
Spring cloud provides us with a set of tools that makes
communication between Microservices easier.
It is used for building robust cloud Application
Spring cloud Appplications run in distributed environment

Monolithic Architecture
 All the software components required for the Application
 are bundled into a single Module
 
 All the components are into single unit and hence whenever
 there is failure in one of the components, all components come 
 to halt.
 
Microservice

It is a service oriented Architecture
Collection of several small independant service. (User, Note, Category, Remainder).
It is SE approach which focusses on decomposing the Application
Modules can indepandantly deployed.
Communication between Microservices is a stateless communication
Each pair of request and response is independant
Microservices can communicate effortlessly with each other.
Each service has its own datasource
