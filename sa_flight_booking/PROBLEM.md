## Case Study: Fligh Details

## Problem Statement

 - Flight Booking is a start-up who have just become operation.  Currently all the operations of the centre are being performed manually
 - The Flight Booking centre has a manager who manually responds the details of the flight to the customer.

# Implement the enquiry module to:
 - Flights

## Implement the reporting module to generate reports for:
 - flight
 - sources 
 - Destinations

## Implement a date management utility.

### Tech Stack
- HTML CSS
- JavaScript
- Jasmine

### Flow of Modules
- Build the date management utility with TDD approach
