## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 5 UserProfileService - NewzApp Assignment

### Problem Statement

In this case study NewzApp Step 5 - UserProfileService, We will write main class for spring boot Application, model class, repository class, service class and interface, logging aspect.

Dockerfile has to be updated with the necessary instructions to create the image for the UserProfileService

### Steps to be followed:

    Step 1: Add relevant dependencies in pom.xml file. 
        Note: Read the comments mentioned in pom.xml file for identifying the relevant dependencies.
    Step 2: Create UserProfileServiceDB.
    Step 3: Write code for model class(i.e UserProfile class).
    Step 4: Write code for UserProfileRepository if needed.
    Step 5: Run UserProfileRepositoryTest.java. 
    step 5: Go thru UserProfileService methods Don't change any method.
    step 6: Go thru exception classes.
    step 7: Implement UserProfileService methods in UserProfileServiceImpl class.
    Step 8:  Run UserProfileServiceImplTest.java.
    step 9: Write code for UserProfileController class.
    step 10: Write the code for JwtFilter in jwtfilter package.
    step 11: Write the code for Swagger configuration in config package.
    step 12: Write code for logger in LoggerAspect.java class consider all methods in controller classes.
    step 13: Go thru UserProfileServiceApplication.java class.
    step 14: Run UserProfileControllerTest.java class.
    step 15: Run Spring boot application (i.e Run As -> spring boot app).
