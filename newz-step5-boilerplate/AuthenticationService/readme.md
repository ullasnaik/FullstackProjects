## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 5 Authentication-Service - NewzApp Assignment

### Problem Statement

In this case study NewzApp Step 5 - Authentication-Service, We will write main class for spring boot Application, model class, repository class, service class and interface, logging aspect.

Dockerfile has to be updated with the necessary instructions to create the image for the AuthenticationService

### Steps to be followed:

    Step 1: Add relevant dependencies in pom.xml file. 
        Note: Read the comments mentioned in pom.xml file for identifying the relevant dependencies.
    Step 2: Create AuthenticationServiceDB.
    Step 3: Write code for model class.
    Step 4: Write code for UserAuthRepository if needed.
    Step 5: Run UserAuthRepositoryTest.java. 
    step 5: Go thru UserAuthService methods. Don't change any method.
    step 6: Go thru exception classes.
    step 7: Implement UserAuthService methods in UserAuthServiceImpl class.
    Step 8:  Run UserAuthServiceTest.java.
    step 9: Write code for UserAuthController class.
    step 10: Write the code for JWT token generation.
    step 11: Write the code for Swagger configuration in config package.
    step 12: Go thru AuthenticationServiceApplication.java class.
    step 13: Run UserAuthenticationControllerTest.java class.
    step 14: Run Spring boot application (i.e Run As -> spring boot app).
