## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 7 - Keep Note Assignment
### Assignment Step Description
In this case study Keep Note Step 7, we will implement and deploy the application developed in step 6 as set of microservices communicating with each other using Apache Kafka.  The microservices should communicate with each other using Netflix-Zuul-API-Gateway and should be registered on nexflix-Eureka-naming-Server.

## User Story:
```
The application needs to keep a track of all the user login attempts which includes the timestamp of the login details. Optionally, you could also add the IP address from which the login is attempted. This information needs to be captured in the User Service and the user should be able to see it when accessing his profile details. 

To achieve this functionality, ensure that for each login attempt, there is a meesage being published by the UserAuthenticationService and for each message published, it should be consumed by UserService and it should be written to a persistent data storage with the following details:

- Username
- Timestamp
- IP address(Optional)
```

In this step, we will create this application in five independently deployed  Micro Services. 

        1. AuthenticationService
        2. UserService
        3. NoteService
        4. CategoryService
        5. ReminderService
        
 ## Steps to be followed for implementing  and deploying application as Micro Services 
 

 ### Select following port to run different MicroServices

### Application		     -		Port
AuthenticationService	- 		9100, 9101, 9102

UserService			-		9200 , 9201

NoteService		-			9300

CategoryService	-			9400 

ReminderService		-			9500 

Netflix Eureka Naming Server -	8761 

Netflix Zuul API Gateway Server	- 8765 

=======================================

### You should set following propertes for Microservices
### application.propertes for all Services except Eureka server 
========================

  spring.application.name= {{name of the application }}

  server.port=  {{port number suggested above}}

  eureka.client.service-url.default-zone=http://localhost:8761/eureka


  #################################

  To run application on multiple port 
  In Eclipse IDE ->  Right Click application  -> RunAs => Run Configuration 
  VM arguments 
   -DServer.port={{portnumber}}

  --------------------------------------
  Project Dependencies
  ============================
  Project should be created with Spring Initializer (start.spring.io) with follwing dependency
  Web, DevTools, Feign, Ribbon, EurekaDiscovery , Zuul
  JPA can be taken where persistance is required. 
  Note that  For project EurekaNaming server 
  Port:8761
  Spring Initializer dependency is Eureka Server and not Discovery 
### Steps to be followed:
    Step 1: Clone the boilerplate in a specific folder on your local machine and import the same in your eclipse STS
    Step 2: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for AuthenticationService and run the test cases.
    Step 3: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for UserService and run the test cases.
    Step 4: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for NoteService  and run the test cases.
    Step 5: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for CategoryService and run the test cases.
    Step 6: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for ReminderService and run the test cases.
Import point to be taken care in implementaion of MS
Step 7: All communication between different services should be done through Netflix-Feign and client side load balancing should be done using nexflix-Ribbon 
### Project structure
The folders and files you see in this repositories, is how it is expected to be in projects, which are submitted for automated evaluation by Hobbes

#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step7-kafka** of your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab.stackroute.in/stack_java_keep_v2/keepnote-step7-kafka-boilerplate.git assignment-solution-step7-kafka`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step6 folder

    `cd assignment-solution-step7-kafka`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step7-kafka` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab.stackroute.in/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-step7-kafka`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`            

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed

### Important instructions for Participants

> - The code must be properly indented, code structure maintained as per the boilerplate and properly commented
> - Follow through the problem statement shared with you

### MENTORS TO BEGIN REVIEW YOUR WORK ONLY AFTER ->
> - You add the respective Mentor as a Reporter/Master into your Assignment Repository
